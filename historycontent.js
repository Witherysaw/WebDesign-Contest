    Well, our beloved general Jingyuan has finally arrvied. He is voiced by Cyno's voice actor, Alejandro Saab in english. \
    He also has a stand and voiced by none other than Daisuke Ono, who voiced jotaro. A long hair daddy stand user, who is also voiced\
    by the VA of THE jotaro? Things couldn't get better than this... Right? Well, CN players and some players in global have rather 'different' take.\
    They think Jingyuan is far from perfect at least in terms of meta and power. Let's explore why is that.\
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <h3>The locals also helped tremendously</h3>\
    Jingyuan was a beast in the final CBT(Closed Beta Test) to a point, where his AOE dmg output is very close to Seele's single target dmg output.\
    Which is crazy to think about, like an AOE dmg so big that rivals the best single target DPS's dmg? That is extremely good.\
    Unfortunatly, my heart was shattered after his release. He is still the best AOE damage dealer in the game at release but by barely\
    His damage output wasn't close to what he once did + we have serval a free 4 star unit who has the same element and path, euridition path.\
    When we thought, things couldn't get worse, chinese player base said 'Hold my chinese tea'. They went wild and even dug up the data form CBT\
    to compare with. And man, is it sad seeing the comparison.\
    <br>\
    <div class='row'><img src='img/historycontent1.jpg' class='col-6' id='hsr1type1'></img>\
    <p class='col-6'>Buffs are colored Green and Nerfs are colored Red. Just from the numbers alone,we can see there are more nerfs then buffs.\
    But it gets worse. Let's talk about the buffs first. First one is the amount of lighting lord stacks he can gained from technique is increased from 2 to 3.\
    This is pretty good considering how valuable those stacks are for Jinyuan.\
    Another buff is his 2nd main trace, where if he have more than 6 stacks of lighting lord stacks, his Crit dmg increases.\
    That trace is buffed form 20% to 25% crit dmg increase.</p></div>\
    <br>\
    <br>\
    Now lets get to nerfs, and ooooh boi are they harsh. First one, total crit rate gain from trace notes is decreased from 18.7% to 12%.\
    It hurts my soul just from writing this. A 6.7% crit rate removed?? That is a crime against humanity and should be illegal. Now, we can only dream\
     of a Jinyuan with 18.7% crit rate just from trace notes.\
     Another Nerf is Trace ability is now ATK 28% increase instead of 14.4% lightning DMG increase.\
     Well the numbers are high so, it should be a buff? right?\
     NO! a big NO, why? becuase ATK% in this game is worthless. Its the last offensive you want since there is an abundance of where you can get it.\
     And last one is not that big but still 18 flat base atk reduced is still a nerf.",
